# Memory comparison

The README chart illustrates user-reported Windows RAM usage: **50–70 MB for
Sonder** and **400–700 MB for Spotify**. These are informal observations, not an
independently measured or controlled benchmark. Workload, app versions, warm-up,
cache state, and whether all Spotify processes were included were not verified.
The chart makes no CPU, GPU, energy, or latency claim.

The source values are in `performance-observations.json`. To regenerate the
static PNG and SVG, install matplotlib in a separate documentation environment
and run `python scripts/render-memory-comparison.py`. No charting dependency or
benchmark collection runs in the client.

For a controlled comparison, use the same Windows PC, playlist, playback time,
and cache state. Compare optimized release builds after warm-up, include every
process in each application's process group, and record the exact Task Manager
memory metric and app versions. Repeated samples matter more than one reading.

# Runtime bounds

Playlist browsing represents unloaded rows by their logical indices rather than
allocating a placeholder per song. It retains eight 15-item metadata pages,
requests the actual visible range after a 100 ms debounce, and discards older
pages. Navigation remembers one inactive playlist and one inactive album;
inactive metadata also follows the catalog's freshness and memory limits.
Older playlist chunks are evicted, but scroll position is retained: revisiting a
distant range refetches that range directly. Playback continues independently
using Spotify's raw item cursor.

Artwork has a shared 128-entry / 16 MiB retained-image budget (decoded pixels
and retained compressed sources combined; one oversized entry is allowed). Detail pages use
the same theme background as search, with no cover-colour sampling. Artist
skeletons are static; there is no shimmer timer or new blur pass.


# Review of 0.8.7–0.8.11

Discrete wheel input is coalesced into one fixed-size accumulator per window.
An 80 ms ease-out preserves line distance and the operating system's wheel
setting; it does not add momentum. Precise touchpad input, scrollbar dragging,
keyboard navigation and reduced-motion input remain direct. Direction reversal,
pointer movement, clicks and route changes cancel pending movement. One frame
callback is outstanding at most; settling stops frame demand. Only native
scroll recipients are invalidated, rather than repainting the entire workspace
for an animation timer. No extra track metadata, background blur or network
request is needed for a scroll frame.

The artist virtual list now preserves its release anchor through zoom/column
changes instead of resetting to the header. Track rows retain a constant stride
with permanent gaps around selection/hover fills; Popular uses a smaller fixed
stride. Context-menu identity shares the existing track ID rather than
formatting another string on every visible row repaint. Stable artist/header
geometry is checked before scheduling deferred updates, avoiding allocation of
no-op closures on normal scroll frames.

The recent paging, artwork, header-docking and Discord paths were reviewed:
playlist metadata remains eight pages, artwork eviction drops renderer images,
blur work is cached, scroll callbacks capture weak page handles, identity
settling has a finite deadline, and Discord keeps a replaceable watch value
rather than an accumulating event queue. This source review found no obvious
new retention cycle in those paths. It is not a Windows heap/GPU profile and
does not establish zero leaks or zero rendering cost. Smooth wheel movement
necessarily draws intermediate frames during input; it adds no idle polling.

Popular requests Spotify's ranked top-tracks endpoint where the application's
API access permits it, preserving Spotify's response order. A 403/404 disables
that probe for the session (shared across client clones), retaining artist
search as a fallback. Auth, rate-limit and server errors retain normal handling.
Spotify's [February 2026 changes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/references/changes/february-2026)
removed top tracks for new Development Mode apps, so the fallback cannot promise
the same ranking as Spotify's own client. No private scraping endpoint or
continuous popularity polling is added.


# Cached suggestions and artwork polish (0.8.12)

Search autocomplete waits 120 ms after typing and returns at most six
identity references into loaded favorites, recent history and liked songs.
One cancellable task shares the existing library arrays temporarily; matching
runs on the background executor, and no full-text index, persistent suggestion
cache, artwork request or Spotify request is added. Query matching is limited
to 96 characters and eight words. ASCII matches scan borrowed bytes; Unicode
case folding uses temporary strings. A new query replaces the prior task.
Escape, submission, route changes and outside clicks dismiss suggestions.
Playback resolves and validates the original track identity against current
library data, cloning full metadata only after activation. Enter without a
selected suggestion continues to perform the explicit Spotify search.

Album track rows omit their image elements entirely, avoiding repeated artwork
lookups. The large album cover has two static box shadows, not a blurred duplicate
image or animated effect. The artist fade uses the same existing gradient and
solid seam layers in a smaller area near Popular; no new image processing pass
is added. Pending playback keeps a static play/pause icon rather than running a
spinner. These changes add small, bounded suggestion state and transient search
work during typing; they do not establish a measured zero-cost CPU/GPU claim.

# Rail and playlist recovery (0.8.13)

Collapsed-sidebar labels reuse one trigger-bounds cell per sidebar. Their native
hover lifecycle positions a single tooltip at the trigger's center with no
additional animation, polling or idle frame requests. Track numbers and play
controls share a fixed 44 by 32 logical-pixel area at 100% zoom. GPU opacity
styles switch the glyph on hover without changing row layout or creating a task.
Play callbacks share their existing allocation between row and index activation.
Track covers no longer create navigation controls.

Failed playlist pages stop requesting until an explicit retry. An initial
failure shows the actual error instead of a logical playlist full of skeletons;
retry requests the missing visible page (or the first page before layout) once.
The existing 100 ms scroll debounce, eight-page/120-track cache, cancellation,
Spotify throttling gate and playback window bounds remain in place. A 403
response explains Spotify's owner/collaborator restriction without retrying or
trying to work around it. No new network request is added to successful loads.

These are code bounds and regression checks, not a Windows CPU/GPU or long-run
RAM measurement. No claim of zero overhead or a measured speedup is made.


# Audio, artwork and short artist pages (0.8.14)

Playback reuses its float-conversion, channel-mapping and resampling buffers.
Stereo channel mapping and matching-rate output borrow their inputs directly.
Resampling uses Rubato's preallocated-output API with the same FFT settings;
regression tests compare exact samples against its allocating API across four
output rates and irregular packet boundaries. Reset clears pending samples and
resampler history without discarding buffer capacity. A repeated-packet test
checks that warmed buffer pointers and capacities stay unchanged. This reduces
allocation churn; it does not change the audio queue, quality or supported devices.

Artwork requests choose power-of-two sizes from 64 to 2048 physical pixels,
including UI zoom and display scale, and preserve the source aspect ratio.
Small artwork is not enlarged. One decoded size per URL and its compressed
source share the existing byte budget. Upgrades reuse that source and keep the
old thumbnail visible until ready; in-flight downloads finish before upgrading.
Two shared workers bound simultaneous download/decode/blur work. Downloads
retain the existing 10 MiB cap and timeouts; decoders additionally limit source
dimensions and allocation. Decode work has transient memory outside the
retained cache budget. Completed results are accounted and evicted on the UI
thread even while the window is idle. Cache clearing cancels waiting requests;
an abort-on-drop guard also cancels the underlying Tokio HTTP task.
Notifications hold a weak cache owner, and pending views are drained on
completion. Blur reads the source pixel slice directly rather than cloning it.

The approved artist backdrop extends 46 logical pixels farther at 100% zoom
and uses static gradient bands. Header and Popular share a virtual item so the
fade cannot disappear early when the header scrolls out. Track spacing and
discography virtualization remain unchanged. Docking uses the smaller of the
normal transition distance and actual available scroll distance; short pages
therefore reach the dock. Switching artists retains a usable Back destination.
Regression tests scroll short pages, switch artist, scroll again and click Back.

These changes have structural bounds and regression coverage. They have not
been measured with a Windows allocation profiler or a long-running GPU/CPU
capture, so they do not establish a measured speedup or prove absence of every leak.


# Continuous artist fade (0.8.15)

The artist backdrop replaces five adjacent gradient rectangles with one
full-size native gradient. This removes internal
rasterization boundaries that can leave a gap or overlap at fractional Windows
DPI/zoom. The image extent and content spacing are unchanged. The gradient
starts at 58% of the backdrop height and reaches the page colour at 96%,
closely approximating the previous opacity curve without internal joins.
A page-colour end fill starts after the fade is opaque and avoids colour-rounding seams.
Both fills remain borderless, preserving the Windows renderer's unrounded fast path
and avoiding outer-edge antialiasing over the image.
This reduces the fade overlay from six quads to two without adding a texture,
blur pass, timer or cache.


Discrete wheel smoothing now advances by elapsed frame time rather than
restarting its easing clock on each input event. New input contributes at
least 45% of its distance on the first presented frame, with the remainder
decaying over subsequent frames and an 80 ms settling cutoff after input stops.
Reversals discard the old direction immediately. An eight-point tolerance
prevents tiny pointer jitter from discarding pending movement; larger pointer
moves, clicks, keys and route changes still cancel it. Precise pixel input and
reduced-motion scrolling retain their direct native path. State remains fixed
size with one outstanding frame callback and no per-input deferred dispatch,
queue, timer or idle polling. Tests cover first-frame response, reversal,
sustained input distance, bounded tails and pointer jitter.

Track play glyphs now follow the existing whole-row hover group. The fixed
index area, click actions, row geometry and keyboard tab order are unchanged;
no animation or task is added. The native hover reference activates from the
row centre rather than the index to cover this behaviour.

# Gallery search and Windows lifetime

Submitted search replaces playlist discovery with albums in the same combined
Spotify request with a five-item limit per type. It retains at most three artists, four albums and five playable
songs, preserving Spotify's result order. Opening a card uses its loaded ID;
there is no follow-up search or album-track/discography prefetch. All sections
share one scroll area and reuse the standard track rows and bounded artwork
cache. These small result groups are laid out directly; library, playlist and
artist discography virtualization are unchanged. Layout measurement schedules
an update only when the content width changes. Portraits are decoded for their
short edge and cover images for their displayed size, including zoom/DPI.
Albums add up to four artwork entries to the existing shared budget, rather
than creating an additional image cache.

Clearing or replacing search now also clears its nested track list immediately;
previously that list could retain the last search's track metadata. Read-only
catalog workers select against their reply receiver closing, so abandoning a
page cancels its HTTP future or rate-limit wait. Write workers keep their
existing completion semantics. Tests cover one combined HTTP request, bounded
result counts, no detail prefetch, shared scrolling, card navigation, album
header artist links, cancellation and release of the old search allocation.

The review of the recent cached-suggestion, row-hover, rail-tooltip, paging,
artist-docking/fade, audio and artwork changes found no additional unbounded
collection or obvious strong-reference cycle in those paths. Existing tests
cover warm audio-buffer reuse, bounded artwork concurrency/cache eviction,
playlist viewport paging and finite wheel settling. This is a source-level
review and regression coverage, not a Windows heap, CPU or GPU measurement.
The useful next measurement is a release-build Windows working-set/private-byte
and GPU-memory trace during repeated browsing and playback; idle after warm-up
and retained cache bytes should be recorded separately from transient decoding.
Reducing artwork retention would trade memory for redecoding/refetching, so the
shared budget is left unchanged without evidence that a smaller one improves
the target workload.

Windows now uses GPUI's native last-window-close exit behavior. The prior
explicit-only quit policy intentionally kept the whole process and playback
alive without a window. Closing the last window now invokes normal application
shutdown, saving playback position and stopping the backend/Discord services.
macOS retains its standard Dock/menu-bar lifetime. Window reconciliation opens
a replacement before closing the old window, preserving sign-in transitions.

# Artist discography pagination (0.8.17)

An artist opens with ten release records. Additional ten-record pages are
requested only when the end of the loaded grid enters the clipped viewport,
one request at a time. There is no catalog-wide prefetch, timer, or scroll-time
sorting. A failed page keeps the existing releases visible and offers Retry;
a page containing only duplicate or unusable IDs requires explicit continuation
instead of automatically walking the rest of the catalog. Raw Spotify offsets
advance by response entries, including entries without usable IDs.

Loaded releases are ordered by release date descending across page boundaries.
Year-only and month-only dates use January 1 and the first of the month;
missing/invalid dates sort last and equal dates retain arrival order. Spotify's
endpoint does not expose an ordering parameter: dates of unseen pages cannot
be compared until those pages arrive. Normally ordered responses append without
moving existing records. Out-of-order arrivals use binary insertion, preserving
the visible album's row anchor. All of this runs when a page finishes loading.

Album rows remain virtualized. Appending preserves already measured row heights;
only the old footer and newly added rows need measurement. Artwork uses the
existing shared bounded cache. The current artist retains only visited release
metadata and an ID deduplication set, both released when switching artists or
clearing the page. Dropping a page request cancels its read-only HTTP future;
late replies cannot overwrite another artist. No additional persistent cache is
created. Tests cover raw cursor handling, partial dates, cross-page sorting,
duplicate pages, retry, single-flight requests, route cancellation, scroll
anchors and release of retained allocations. This is structural/test evidence,
not a claim of measured Windows CPU, GPU or long-running heap usage.

# Visible artwork and local feedback (0.8.18)

Cover loading starts in clipped prepaint, never from image measurement. Virtual
overscan rows do not start downloads or decode work. Each drawing view registers
its current pending cover demand in one deferred batch; requests no longer
needed by that view are dropped, including semaphore waiters and abort-on-drop
HTTP work. Other drawing views keep their shared requests. Switching artists
also releases the old grid's pending demand. These batches do not request frames
or poll while idle, and their bookkeeping is removed after the draw.

The entry ceiling is 128 instead of 48 so a dense visible discography can coexist
with rail thumbnails. Combined decoded pixels and compressed sources retain the
same 32 MiB budget (with the existing single-oversize exception), two workers,
download limits and decode limits. Actual retained bytes can increase within
that existing ceiling when more small covers fit. There is no new disk cache or
catalog-wide image prefetch. Pending/failed covers have a static neutral fill; loaded covers draw no extra placeholder quad.
Tests exercise 80 thumbnails without refetch, cancellation before newer work,
o network work from offscreen measurement, and the unchanged byte budget.

The player holds its current track in one Arc; a cached metadata child updates
only when that allocation changes or its artwork is invalidated. Image eviction
and cache clearing send one batched event to refresh cached scene fragments,
without an accumulating per-image view registry. A 100-position-update test verifies no extra
metadata renders and the same track allocation, followed by one refresh on a
track change. Album/artist links and theme/size invalidation remain covered.
Sidebar toggles assign the final content width once; local rail label/fill
feedback remains finite. Artist identity metadata is synchronized on navigation
and replies rather than copied during every page render. Existing docking text
and its bounded motion are preserved; GPUI already caches shaped text, so no
second font cache or rasterized text texture is added.

Track menus use an opaque surface, a loaded track summary, grouped actions and
existing bundled glyphs. All previous actions remain. Their 150 ms ease-out
opacity entrance does not animate geometry or delay clicks; dismissal is direct.
Transport pointer feedback is immediate with a 100 ms opacity return. The
native GPUI version has no general paint-scale transform for child trees, so
these controls retain their size/hit area and use opacity rather than adding
layout scaling or a renderer fork. Keyboard activation and reduced motion add
no interpolation; every frame request is bounded to an active transition.
Play/pause glyph assets remain unchanged. These tests and code bounds do not
constitute a Windows CPU/GPU profile or proof of zero allocations/leaks globally.

# Review of 0.8.25 (playback repaints and artwork copies)

Position reports now arrive every 500 ms instead of 250 ms, and the player only
repaints when the displayed second changes. The clock text changes once a
second and the progress bar moves under a pixel per report, so the extra
repaints drew nothing new. This cuts frame work and wake-ups while a song plays.

The picture cache no longer keeps each compressed original in memory when the
artwork disk cache is active: a larger size is read back from disk instead. The
retained-image budget therefore holds decoded pictures only. Without a disk
cache the originals are still kept, as before.

# Local Files

Local Files costs nothing until a folder is added: no scan runs, no index is
read, the sidebar row stays hidden and the player holds no extra state. The
installed player is the same librespot player; there is no second audio engine.

Folders are walked off the UI thread on a blocking task. A rescan only reads
file sizes and modification times for files it already knows, and files that
could not be read are remembered, so they are not probed again. Leaving the
page or removing a folder drops the reply, which cancels the scan between
files. Rescans happen when Local Files is opened, at most once a minute, and
when the folders change.

Changes are noticed with one operating-system watch per folder (FSEvents on
macOS, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows, through `notify`, which the UI kit
already builds). The watch costs no polling and no thread per folder. Only
music files, and paths that were removed, ask for a rescan; covers, lyrics and
anything in a hidden folder do not. A change waits until the folders have been
quiet for 1.5 seconds, so copying an album or retagging it is one rescan, and a
change during a scan queues one more scan after it rather than starting a
second one.

Searching the page filters the list already in memory, without a query to the
backend or SQLite. The result is kept until the list or the query changes, so
repaints don't search again.

The list is one shared `Arc<[Track]>` capped at 20,000 tracks, with a note on
the page when a library is larger. A track takes about the same memory as a
Liked Songs track: measured at roughly 870 bytes each with typical paths,
about 0.9 MB per 1,000 songs and 17 MB at the cap. The index is saved in SQLite
so the page paints from it before the rescan answers.

Embedded covers are read from the file when a row first shows them and go
through the shared 16 MiB artwork budget; there is no new cache. Songs from one
album in one folder share their first song's cover, so an album decodes one
picture rather than one per song.

Spotify streams take the same decoder path as before, with the same one copy
per packet. Only local files that are not 44.1 kHz stereo are resampled, in
1,024-frame chunks. Unit tests play WAV files at three rates and channel counts
through the real player and check the exact output length; MP3, FLAC, Ogg,
AAC and ALAC M4A, and 96 kHz 5.1 WAV files were also played to the end. These
are code bounds and tests, not a Windows working-set measurement of the app.

# Lyrics

Lyrics cost nothing until they are turned on in Settings and opened: the button
is not drawn, no pane is built on screen, and nothing is asked of the network.
Once open, a song costs one small request to LRCLIB (a second only when no exact
match exists), cancelled if the song changes first. The answer is parsed into a
sorted line list of a few kilobytes, and the last 16 songs' answers are kept,
including songs with no lyrics, so reopening or skipping back asks nothing.

Following a song is a binary search for the current line and one timer set for
the moment the next line starts, so the view redraws once per lyric line, not
once per frame, and not at all while paused. Only the nine or so lines near the
current one are built. Unsynced lyrics are a plain scrolling list. Responses
are limited to 512 KiB. These are code bounds and tests, not a Windows
working-set measurement of the app.
